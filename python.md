Scenario :

    AIRPORT scenario :
     
        OnBoarding :

            1) Check in Baggage
            2) Immigration Check
            3) Security Check
            4) Boarding

        Aboarding : 

            1) Landing
            2) Collect the Baggage
            3) Security Check


Problem 1 : 

    1) There were 100 Planes in the Airplane track
    2) After few hours 25 Planes took off
    3) After few hours 63 planes landed.

    Current no of planes : 61, 136


Solution to Client Problem : 
AirBNB : 

    Input : 

        initial_no_of_planes = 100
        took_off = 25
        landed_planes = 63

    Solution : 

        current_no_of_planes = initial_no_of_planes - took_off + landed_planes
                             = 100 - 25 + 63
                             = 138

    Output : 

        current_no_of_planes -> 138

    Input Gathering -> Solution (Process | Algorithm |) -> Output

    1) Flow Chart : 

    2) Pseudo Code : 

            Input : 

            initial_no_of_planes = 100
            took_off = 25
            landed_planes = 63

            Solution : 

                current_no_of_planes = initial_no_of_planes - took_off + landed_planes
                                    = 100 - 25 + 63
                                    = 138

            Output : 

                current_no_of_planes -> 138
